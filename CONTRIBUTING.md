## Naming conventions

- Functions: must use only lowercase letters and each word must be separated by underscore (ex: `my_function`, `function`).
- Variables: must use only lowercase letters and each word must be separated by underscore (ex: `my_var`, `var`).
- Add docstrings in every function or class you create.
